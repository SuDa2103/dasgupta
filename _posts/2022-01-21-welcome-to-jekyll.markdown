#### TL;DR
* I started with the programming language and framework I was most familiar with, which in my case is Ruby on Rails. Sounds obvious, but a lot of people go out and try to learn the hot, new technology out there. 
* I followed tutorials like Build A Clone of X in rails. If you can, start with something like this. Find the tutorial that is closest to what you want to build. 
* I used gems and external libraries to help me build the more fancy features
* If you’re curious - my MVP is here - https://www.hodlernews.io/


#### Rails
I love programming in Ruby. It’s the first programming language I learned and I loved it so much, I decided to go and get a job where I can do some programming. After I started working in tech, I realised that having to look at Java code is quite different to programming in rails, and I found this much less fun than I expected. 


##### Build a Reddit Clone Tutorial
At its core, the product I wanted to build was a forum. So I found a reddit clone tutorial on YouTube, and followed it step by step. This turned out to be very useful, because the tutorial included bits of code that I would have never been able to add myself. For example, this snippet of code deals with ranking posts on the homepage. While I’m sure I would’ve got around to this, I’m not sure I would have had this kind of system ready for the MVP, had I not come across this great tutorial.


#### Build a Job Board
The next thing I wanted to build was a jobs board. In terms of implementation, this was pretty similar to implementing the normal posts. 


#### The Front End
I realised that using HTML tables made laying out my job board page much, much easier. I then used sites like coolors.co. I took inspiration from the indie hackers website, and decided that darker = better.
